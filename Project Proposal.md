### Project 7 Proposal

#### Analysis Objective:
When a client consider to submit an offer to a property, the real estate agent always runs a competitive analysis report for the client. And those competitive reports are valuable, especially in popular markets, to decide how much the client should offer to the seller in order to bid the property. The goal of this project is to create a live dashboard as an open source for property buyers, which enables them to run real time competitive analysis by themselves. And I'll also leverage linear regression to predict how many percents the closing price would be below/above the listing price.

#### Data Description:
I'm thinking to use a [Realtor API](https://rapidapi.com/datascraper/api/us-real-estate/) to extract data of sold and active listings in Bay area, CA and SF.

#### Tools:
* Python3
* Mangodb
* Realtor API

#### MVP Goal:
* A Mangodb database, a data transformation pipeline and some dashboard charts
